Simulation description:

 

1.       Scenario: London, with downtown and suburbs. A cluster of sources in downtown, and a cluster of destinations in suburb. Random targets mid-way, perpendicular. 10000 vehicles, 25 targets.  Spread the start time of vehicles over a period. Make sure, that at any given time, there are only about 50 vehicles in the scene.

2.       Routes: 2 cases

a.       Case 1: For each vehicle, great random source and destination, and  assign a target which will cause the least diversion.

b.       Case 2: Assign target according to Nash equilibrium.

3.       Measurements:

a.       For each target, measure all the sampling times.

b.       For each vehicle, store source, destination, shortest path length, diversion path length, sample time (time when the vehicle reached the target), target id.
